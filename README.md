I have programmed an extremely simple/basic python script that evaluates the strength of the user's password and provides feedback on how to improve it. 
It uses the 're' module for providing support of regular expressions checking (pattern matching within the password string).

Explanation of the code (feel free to skip this part):
- check_password_strength function takes the password as an input and returns the strength score of the password along with feedback on how to improve it (if any is needed).
- The "checks" such as "digital check" and "uppercase letter check" etc... are a set of criteria programmed using if-else statements that act as a checklist or a set of rules that the password must abide to.

   The rest is pretty much self-explanatory :)
